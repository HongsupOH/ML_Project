# ML_Project
This is a collection of machine learning implementations developed by Hongsup Oh and Jacob Zamora for the CS5350/6350 project at the University of Utah. 
## bingo_bias_variance_decomposition
This folder contains functions, input files, and results related to implementing a bias/variance decomposition (BVD) fitness function that aims to improve model generalization within the context of explicit regression. 
## implicit_guidelines
This folder contains input files and results related to developing training guidelines to improve computational performance of GPSR within the context of implicit regression.

## Note
Our project utilizes [Bingo](https://github.com/nasa/bingo), an open-source software package initially developed at NASA that we implement through resources provided by the University of Utah Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC). Our input SLURM job scripts link to builds of Bingo within our CHPC directories. Therefore, if using our implementations, a CHPC account is required. Bingo can be locally installed as described in its GitHub page, which would require modification of our SLURM scripts to use our implementations for this project.
